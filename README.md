# Weather Forecast Application

## Overview

This project is an experimental product born out of my tinkering with ChatGPT. While I may be new to coding, I found that using ChatGPT as a resource helped me create this simple weather forecast application. The application fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the current weather for a user-specified city.

## Features

- **City Input**: Users can enter the name of a city to get its current weather.
- **Weather Data**: Displays temperature and weather conditions.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work well on various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and API interaction.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Fetching weather data.
